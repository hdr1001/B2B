## Introduction
In this repository I want to bring together all the B2B (D&B, GLEIF, ...) code I have developed over time and expand from there. Initially the most important sources will be the following GitHub repositories: [API Hub - Request, Persist & Respond (v4)](https://github.com/hdr1001/api_hub_rpr_v4) and [D&B Direct+ utilities (v3)](https://github.com/hdr1001/dnbDplUtilities_v3).

## GitHub repo
I created the GitHub [B2B repo](https://github.com/hdr1001/B2B) in my browser:

Next, using Visual Studio Code (VSC) functionality, I cloned the repository to my PC:
