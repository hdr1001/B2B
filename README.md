## Introduction
In this repository I want to bring together all the B2B (D&B, GLEIF, ...) code I have developed over time and expand from there. Initially the most important sources will be the following GitHub repositories: [API Hub - Request, Persist & Respond (v4)](https://github.com/hdr1001/api_hub_rpr_v4) and [D&B Direct+ utilities (v3)](https://github.com/hdr1001/dnbDplUtilities_v3).

## GitHub repo
I created the GitHub [B2B repo](https://github.com/hdr1001/B2B) in my browser:

![Online creation of GitHub repository][def00001]

Next, using Visual Studio Code (VSC) functionality, I cloned the repository to my PC:

![Clone the GitHub repo][def00002]

## First Node.js script
Initialized the folder structure of the backend part of the project and the Node Package Manager:

![npm init][def00003]

Executed minimal Node.js script:

![npm run][def00004]

## Testing fetch to consume GLEIF data
Implemented three different GLEIF API requests using fetch (separated [definitions](https://bit.ly/47sHzLb) from the [implementation](https://bit.ly/3Yt3E8q)):

![fetch GLEIF][def00005]

## Added rate limiter
Always use John Hurliman's [rate limiter](https://github.com/jhurliman/node-rate-limiter) but please note the pinned version!

![rate limiter][def00006]

With the rate limiter in place it is possible to launch multiple requests while, at the same time, respecting the TPS limit set by GLEIF.

## Using fetch to retrieve a D&B Direct+ token

Moving on with code to retrieve a D&B Direct+ [token](https://directplus.documentation.dnb.com/openAPI.html?apiID=authentication) using fetch. Had to install module [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv?ref=hackernoon.com) to savely store the API credentials.

![Fetch D+ token][def00008]

## Project now supports D&B data blocks
Added a new [definition and class](https://bit.ly/3QyfhsV) to support D&B Direct+ data blocks. Also added [test code](https://bit.ly/3DSoZ1t) to the project as well. Shortest way to run the code is in GitHub Codespaces.

![GitHub Codespaces][def00009]

After creating the needed [environment variables](https://github.com/hdr1001/B2B/blob/0dbe961ae68b10fc2d3a4632e3c59a40a472b282/backend/node/dotEnv) as [secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/managing-your-codespaces/managing-encrypted-secrets-for-your-codespaces) running the code is basically a three step process.

![npm run fetch][def00010]

## Module https

I have a lot of experience using [module https](https://nodejs.org/api/https.html#https) for executing API requests. In this repo I decided to use [Fetch](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v18.x/docs/api/globals.html#fetch) instead. Just to be able to compare my [Fetch code](https://github.com/hdr1001/B2B/blob/main/backend/node/src/share/apiDefs.js) with my [https code](https://github.com/hdr1001/B2B/blob/main/backend/node/src/share/httpApiDefs.js) I developed a shared library and test code. Everthing works as expected. I might use module https in the future for implementing a [SOAP API](https://stoplight.io/api-types/soap-api).

![Fetch v. https][def00011]

## Module run-func

Module run-func lets you execute an exported JavaScript function directly from command line. This module must be installed:

![npm i -S run-func][def00012]

With this functionality in place it is possible to create scripts like the dplAuthToken script below:

![script run-func][def00013]

Works like a charm:

![script executed üëçüèª][def00014]

## Script for generating a D&B Direct+ token

A valid authentication token is required in order to request D&B Direct+ data. The script [dnbDplAuthToken.js](https://bit.ly/3PAR8AO) is an implementation of the relevant [Direct+ endpoint](https://bit.ly/3s1wApw). It can be invoked as follows:

![npm run dplAuthToken][def00015]

The script fetches a new token and, depending on the invocation, can:

1. echo the API response to the terminal (set the 1st parameter to true),
2. write the API response to a file (set the 2nd parameter to true),
3. propagate the new token throughout the application (set the 3rd parameter to true),
4. use either v2 or v3 of the endpoint.

The run script in [package.json](https://bit.ly/3RlrYYu) makes sure that a valid token is available for any scripts which will be run after this script.

![npm run script dplAuthToken][def00016]

A D&B Direct+ token is valid for 24 hours.
